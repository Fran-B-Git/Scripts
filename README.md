# Scripts
all my scripts

dhmz.py		: runs in the background supplying my i3 wm bar with weather data

mongo.sh	: short script to start portforwarding for the stroeer mongo db

pagecheck.sh	: script that checks a list of pages (with username:password) and returns the status code

php/rejsonify	: turn kontor into true json

scrape.py	: scrape and gather links from assets

sitemapRandLinks: same as scrape but more

snip.sh		: snipping for $mod+Shift+s on i3

=================================================
# My notes:
## current $mod = windows key

1) snipping:		$mod+shift+s
2) snip and edit:	$mod+ctrl+s
3) connect to new wifi: `nmcli d wifi connect "SSID" password "PASSWORD"`
4) pinta is a good lightweight image editor
5) bg changer is $mod+p
